# Hang in There

### Abstract:

"Hang in There" is an interactive motivational poster generator that allows users to create, view, and save custom inspirational posters or view and save the pre-generated posters. This application solves the problem of not being able to make motivational posters without photoshopping/a lot of extra work, it comes with the ability to create custom designs with user-supplied images, titles, and quotes; it also provides randomly generated posters from our curated dataset. Additionally, it comes with "Unmotivational Posters" to give our users a humorous contrast to the regular posters they know and love.

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:

This is project 1 in turing Module 2, we had about 10 or so days to create a project matching a comp, add javascript functionality to all buttons/events/functions, and create new HTML for unmotivational posters based on the comp.

### Learning Goals:

* Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
    - Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
    - Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
* Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins:
- Successfully implemented all required poster generation goals that allow users to create, save, and manage custom motivational content
- Developed a clean DRY application with reusable code to eliminate any repitition. 
- Created a seemless user side application where the page does not require you to reload for DOM changes.

#### Challenges:
- Ensuring event listeners didn't duplicate elements to prevent unintended behaviors
- Ensuring that the responsive design works across different screen sizes required additional CSS adjustments and testing; a bit funky at times
