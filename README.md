# Hang in There

### Abstract:

"Hang in There" is an interactive motivational poster generator that allows users to create, view, and save custom inspirational posters or view and save the pre-generated posters. This application solves the problem of not being able to make motivational posters without photoshopping/a lot of extra work, it comes with the ability to create custom designs with user-supplied images, titles, and quotes; it also provides randomly generated posters from our curated dataset. Additionally, it comes with "Unmotivational Posters" to give our users a humorous contrast to the regular posters they know and love.
